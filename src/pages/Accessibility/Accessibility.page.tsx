        Many people use assistive technologies such as screen readers or screen
        magnifiers to help them view, read and navigate a website. To ensure our
        site delivers a good experience for all users, we have built and
        modified the site to support the accessibility needs of our customers.

        Our commitment to user friendly and accessible web services
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        We have endorsed the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility
        Guidelines version 2.0 (commonly know as WCAG 2.0).
        <br />
        <br />
        WCAG 2.0 is a series of international standards from the World Wide Web
        Consortium. It identifies techniques to create and manage web content in
        ways that are more accessible to people with disabilities including
        those who may use assistive technologies like screen readers. Websites
        that are more accessible are also generally more user friendly to
        everyone.
